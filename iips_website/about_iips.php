                            " Welcome to International institute of professional studies- a Premier B-School in Central India 
                            which has been providing exceptional opportunities to the students since past 21 years. They have 
                            left an indelible mark that will guide subsequent developments, not only at the institution, but 
                            hopefully also in management education in our country. The new age consumer, industry and trade have 
                            always guided the plan and programmes of the institute. Our belief is that, holistic management 
                            education has to provide young graduates the necessary sensitivity skills which would help them to 
                            relate to their social environment. The institutes like ours have much larger role than just providing 
                            management education, to aspiring potential managers. The purpose of our institute is to induce change 
                            and manage socio-economic development in our country."

                <p class="text-justify"> 
                    Our innovative academic programmes incorporate a tradition of academic excellence and experimental learning with
                    an emphasis on team-work. The institutes environment instills the skills needed to succeed in a competitive 
                    global environment. We imbibe capabilities of working in diversified fields with creativity, imagination and 
                    perseverance in our students. We actively explore and develop new methodologies such as alternative teaching 
                    techniques and learning approaches that promote thinking skills and lifelong learning habits. My belief is 
                    that organizations today new socially sensitive managers. We also believe that trough a whole lot of exercises
                    and cases that these students go through at the institute, they develop a set of values that will help them to
                    manage this environmental change and business organization in an ethical manner. I hope you will find the 
                    qualities of ethical leadership and management in our students.
                    You have always supported IIPS in a very big way. Without your support it would not have been possible for us to achieve the current growth. I am confident that the institute will continue to get your support in all its activities.
